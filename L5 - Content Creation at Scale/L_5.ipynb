      "Analysis: Assessing inflation‚Äôs impact\n",
      "February 13, 2025\n",
      "Key takeaways\n",
      "Although down from a 2022 peak of 9.1%, elevated inflation persists.\n",
      "Not since mid-2023 has the CPI jumped as high as it did in January 2025.\n",
      "Investors anticipate this will mean a delay before the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates further.\n",
      "While Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers and investors wait for clear signals that inflation, which has dissipated greatly since 2022, continues to recede, the latest data tells another story. \n",
      "For the fourth consecutive month, the headline Consumer Price Index (CPI) number moved higher. After dropping to as low as 2.4% for the 12 months ending in September 2024, CPI for the 12 months ending January 2025 is now up to 3.0%. CPI rose 0.5% in January alone, its largest monthly hike since mid-2023.\n",
      "Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, January 2025.\n",
      "Changes in the headline number reflect, in part, rising food and energy costs. For much of 2024, energy prices declined, but the trend was reversed in December and in January, the price pickup continued. Food costs are another major contributor to CPI‚Äôs recent trend. Due to millions of egg-laying chickens being destroyed in response to avian bird flu concerns, shrinking supplies resulted in higher egg prices, a major consumer concern. January‚Äôs inflation report shows egg prices up 15% for the month and 53% (not seasonally adjusted) for the 12 months ending in January.1\n",
      "Core CPI also rises\n",
      "As notable as the primary CPI number is the core CPI figure. Core CPI excludes the volatile food and energy categories. Core CPI rose 3.3% for the 12 months ending in January, a slight increase from December.1 Notably, there‚Äôs been little movement in Core CPI since early 2024.\n",
      "Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, January 2025.\n",
      "‚ÄúThe Federal Reserve is most focused on core data versus the headline CPI number,‚Äù says Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director for U.S. Bank Asset Management. ‚ÄúShelter costs are one area that is closely monitored here.‚Äù Shelter costs make up more than one-third of CPI. In the 12 months ending in January, shelter costs rose 4.4%, contributing to inflation‚Äôs upward trend, although the category‚Äôs increase is down from previous peaks. Transportation services costs, which include components such as auto insurance and repairs, are up 8.0% from January 2024.1\n",
      "All eyes on the Fed\n",
      "From September to December 2024, the Fed reduced the federal funds target rate, a key rate that can impact mortgage rates, auto loans and other key borrowing measures, by 1.0%. A combination of slowing inflation and rising concerns about labor market strength were key factors motivating Fed rate cuts. At its January policymaking meeting, the Fed held interest rates steady. ‚ÄúRecent strong labor reports put more of the Fed‚Äôs focus on inflation again,‚Äù says Haworth.\n",
      "In recent Congressional testimony, Fed chair Jerome Powell confirmed that the Fed‚Äôs interest rate policy may not change much in the near term. ‚ÄúWith our policy stance now significantly less restrictive that it had been and the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,‚Äù said Powell.2\n",
      "Does inflation‚Äôs recent uptick raise the prospect of the Fed shifting its stance and again raising the fed funds target rate? Haworth doesn‚Äôt see an immediate risk. ‚ÄúIt will take more sustained inflation before the Fed flips its rate stance,‚Äù says Haworth. ‚ÄúTo this point, the Fed likely views the recent inflation upturn as transitory.‚Äù\n",
      "Nevertheless, interest rate trades currently see no more than a modest chance of another Fed rate cut before July.3\n",
      "Trade policy‚Äôs impact on inflation\n",
      "While existing inflation challenges are a key focus for markets and Fed policymakers, future inflation factors are less clear. The Trump administration is threatening to impose 25% tariff increases on products imported from two key trading partners, Mexico and Canada. ‚ÄúThe magnitude of tariffs currently being proposed are well beyond previous tariff levels,‚Äù says Haworth. ‚ÄúThis could push prices higher.‚Äù President Trump did implement an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods and implemented a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports.\n",
      "‚ÄúThe magnitude of tariffs currently being proposed, from 10% to 25%, are well beyond previous tariff levels,‚Äù says Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director for U.S. Bank Asset Management. ‚ÄúThis could push prices higher.‚Äù\n",
      "Also on the table are an extension of tax cuts included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which expire after 2025. President Trump is also seeking additional tax cuts on Social Security income and tipped income for service workers. If implemented by the Republican-led Congress, the total package of tax cut extensions and new tax cuts could have stimulative economic effects, which may prove inflationary.\n",
      "Favorable, long-term inflation trend\n",
      "The Fed has indicated a desire to return the fed funds target rate to what it considers a neutral range, although, according to Haworth, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not clear if the Fed now considers its neutral level to be 3% or 4%.‚Äù The rate currently stands at the 4.25% to 4.50% range. The Fed targets 2% inflation, as measured by the annual change in the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index, a measure of spending on goods and services.4 Progress on meeting the Fed‚Äôs 2% inflation target stalled in recent months. For the previous 12 months ending in December 2024, headline PCE trended modestly higher, at 2.6%. The narrower ‚Äúcore‚Äù PCE (excluding the volatile food and energy categories) stayed steady in December at 2.8%, the same as the prior two months.5\n",
      "‚ÄúThough core inflation prices remain higher than overall inflation, the Fed can live with that assuming, as is the case for now, that core costs remain level,‚Äù says Haworth.\n",
      "After soaring in 2021, inflation as measured by CPI, has declined in three consecutive years, though it remains above levels consistently achieved between 2009 and 2020.6\n",
      "Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. 2024 data point based on Consumer Price Index for 12-month period ending January 2025.\n",
      "As for inflation‚Äôs future direction, Haworth says ‚ÄúThere are a lot of questions about the impact of changing government policy, such as potential higher tariffs. Other factors such as the ability of consumers to continue to boost economic growth will have a hand in how much the Fed feels it needs to cut interest rates or whether it needs to shift direction.‚Äù\n",
      "How inflation can impact your portfolio\n",
      "As inflation leveled off in 2023 and 2024, equity markets responded favorably. In 2024, the S&P 500 registered its second consecutive year of 25%-plus total returns.7 Investors may want to consider an overweight allocation to equities relative to fixed income investments, while retaining a neutral weight in real assets.\n",
      "At the same time, it‚Äôs important to remember that a consistent long-term strategy tends to work to the benefit of most investors. This likely precludes any dramatic changes to your asset allocation strategy in response to today‚Äôs capital market environment.\n",
      "Be sure to talk with your financial professional about what steps may be most appropriate for your situation.\n",
      "Frequently asked questions\n",
      "What is the inflation rate?\n",
      "The inflation rate measures the change in living costs for the average consumer over a given period. While there are various measures of inflation, the one most followed is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a measure of changes in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. The inflation rate for the 12 months ending January 2024 (as measured by CPI) was 3.0%, down from a peak of 9.1% in mid-2022, but up modestly from levels reached during 2024‚Äôs summer months.6\n",
      "What does inflation affect?\n",
      "Changes in living costs, reflected by inflation, represent a loss of purchasing power. This is an important consideration not only in your day-to-day living, but in your long-term financial planning. To improve your quality of life over time, you‚Äôll want to see your income grow faster than the inflation rate. To retain your lifestyle in retirement, you want to be sure that income you receive from your own investments and other sources keeps pace with changes in living costs over the course of retirement. This is why inflation has such a significant impact on individuals.\n",
      "What is a high inflation rate?\n",
      "The Federal Reserve, which is charged with maintaining stable prices, targets a long-term inflation rate of 2%. Between 2012 and 2020, the annual inflation rate was between 0.7% and 2.3%. Since that time, inflation has been much higher. It stood at 7.0% in 2021, 6.5% in 2022 and 3.4% in 2023 before dropping to 2.9% in 2024.6 Still, headline inflation remains above the Federal Reserve‚Äôs 2% target.4\n",

      "Thought: I have now gathered a lot of information related to inflation in the US and its impact on the stock market in 2024. It seems that the US inflation rate has been declining since 2022 but still remains above the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. The latest data shows that the headline CPI for the 12 months ending in January 2025 is up to 3.0%. The core CPI, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, rose 3.3% for the 12 months ending in January. The Federal Reserve has been calibrating its policy to keep inflation in check, and it seems that the Fed is not in a hurry to adjust its policy stance. The impact of inflation on the stock market has been mixed, with some stocks struggling to adjust to the new outlook. It's essential to continue monitoring the situation and analyzing the latest news and updates to provide a detailed summary report.\u001b[00m\n",

      "outlook. In this scenario, continued geopolitical conflicts and trade actions cause inflation to stay higher for longer, driving the Federal Reserve to hike rates.1 Scenarios Baseline (70%): Real GDP growth slowed overall in the first quarter of 2024, coming in very close to our previous forecast‚Äôs expectations.2 We expect GDP growth will continue to moderate through the second half of this year and the start of the next, but the story is still positive overall. Consumer spending is forecasted to rise 2.3% this year, up from the 2.2% increase in 2023. Business investment is expected to increase 3% in 2024, down from 4.5% last year. Government spending is forecasted to rise 2.5%. Given that the US economy is expected to outperform many other global economies in the short term, we forecast imports to increase 3.1% on average in 2024, while exports are predicted to rise at a slower pace of 2.4%. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation stays above the 3% threshold for the second quarter of this year before falling to 2.7% by the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve succeeds in walking the tightrope to a soft landing by cutting rates twice in the second half of 2024 and continues with cuts until reaching the neutral rate of 2.5% to 3% by 2027. Job growth slows because current levels of job formation are not sustainable, given demographics and labor force participation. As a result, the unemployment rate falls in the short term, but rises to just under 4% in 2025 before gradually declining through the rest of the forecast period. Major investments prompted by the Inflation Reduction Act provide a boost to manufacturing.3 In addition, investments in intellectual property‚Äîsuch as the use of AI and other novel technologies‚Äîwill continue to drive growth in the business sector. Overall, we expect the US economy to post real GDP growth of 2.4% this year, but for growth to slow to 1.1% in 2025. Between 2026 and 2028, economic growth is expected to pick back up, with annual gains in\n",

      "real GDP forecasted to range between 1.6% and 1.9% per year. Persistent inflation and geopolitical conflicts (20%): While our baseline remains positive, there are always downside risks to any forecast. We see risks centering around three interrelated issues: 1) geopolitical conflicts, 2) persistent inflation, and 3) financial system stress. Major conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have been simmering for some time; either or both could flare up to a higher level. We see the most likely impact of such escalation coming in the form of higher prices of imported goods and oil. In this scenario, the price of oil spikes to around US$100 for three quarters before gradually declining. Geopolitical conflicts are not just fought with guns. The past two American administrations have used tariffs and sanctions to varying degrees as tools to influence adversaries. The use of these tools can have an impact on the prices faced by American firms and consumers. In this scenario, we model tariffs that increase the cost of imported intermediate inputs by 1% and imported final goods by a further 1%. As a result of the tariffs and the oil price shock, the Federal Reserve is driven to hike rates twice in the near term. Even with this action, CPI inflation persists above 3% until the second quarter of 2025. The latest Federal Reserve Financial Stability Report4 highlights three near-term risks to the stability of the financial system: higher-for-longer interest rates; worsening geopolitical conflict and spillovers; and strains on real-estate markets, particularly for office real estate. In line with the other assumptions outlined above, we therefore model an increase in stress in the financial system. In this scenario, GDP growth is lower than in the baseline scenario, particularly over the next two years. Growth in 2024 is 2.2%; by the following year, the tariffs are fully implemented, and growth in 2025 is just 0.6%. Growth averages 1.7% per year from 2026 to 2028. A golden era\n",

      "Introduction:\n",
      "The current US inflation rate is around 3.0% for the 12 months ending in January 2025, with a core inflation rate of 3.3% for the same period. The Federal Reserve has been calibrating its policy to keep inflation in check, and it seems that the Fed is not in a hurry to adjust its policy stance. The impact of inflation on the stock market has been mixed, with some stocks struggling to adjust to the new outlook.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key Insights:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Inflation has historically correlated with lower returns on equities. Value stocks tend to perform better than growth stocks in high inflation periods.\n",
      "2. The relationship between equity prices and inflation is often an inverse correlation ‚Äì i.e., as inflation rises, stock prices fall, or as inflation falls, stock prices rise.\n",
      "3. Moderate inflation is generally good for equities because it tends to be associated with positive economic growth, rising profits, and stock price gains.\n",
      "4. The Federal Reserve's policy decisions will play a crucial role in shaping the inflation landscape and its impact on the stock market.\n",
      "\n",

      "1. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has provided a boost to manufacturing and investments in intellectual property.\n",
      "2. The Federal Reserve's efforts to keep inflation in check may lead to higher interest rates, which could impact the stock market.\n",
      "3. Geopolitical conflicts and trade tensions may lead to higher inflation and volatility in the stock market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Economic Indicators:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a key indicator of inflation and its impact on the stock market.\n",
      "2. The Producer Price Index (PPI) is another important indicator of inflation and its effects on the stock market.\n",
      "3. The unemployment rate and job market data will be crucial in understanding the impact of inflation on the economy and the stock market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "In conclusion, the impact of inflation on the stock market in 2024 is complex and influenced by various factors, including geopolitical conflicts, monetary policy, and consumer spending.

      "## Understanding Inflation in 2024\n",
      "\n",
      "Inflation continues to be a significant factor influencing economic conditions in the United States. As we look into 2024, experts predict that inflation rates will experience moderate fluctuations, driven by various elements such as consumer demand, production costs, and government policies. The Federal Reserve's response to these dynamics will also play an essential role in determining inflation levels and their broader implications for the economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recent data suggests that inflation rates are stabilizing following the tumultuous spikes seen during the pandemic years. However, economists note that underlying factors like labor shortages and supply chain disruptions could sustain pressure on prices. As consumers adjust their spending patterns, it will be crucial to monitor how these shifts translate into inflationary trends throughout the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "## The Stock Market's Reaction to Inflation\n",
      "\n",
      "Stock markets typically react to inflation signals, often viewing rising prices as a precursor to increased interest rates. In 2024, investors must remain vigilant as the Federal Reserve may tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, potentially leading to market volatility. Historical perspectives indicate that periods of high inflation can pressure corporate margins and investment valuations, creating a challenging environment for equities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, sectors may respond differently to inflationary pressures. For example, energy and utilities often perform better during inflationary periods, while technology stocks might face headwinds as borrowing costs rise. Thus, understanding sectoral performances will be key for investors looking to navigate the stock market in 2024 effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Insights from Analysts\n",
      "\n",
      "### Inflation Projections\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Projected Rate**: Analysts anticipate inflation to hover around 3-4% in 2024, slightly above the Federal Reserve's target.\n",
      "- **Consumer Behavior**: Expect ongoing shifts in consumer spending due to sustained price pressures, impacting overall economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Stock Market Strategy\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Diversification**: Investors are advised to diversify portfolios to mitigate risks associated with sector-specific downturns during inflationary periods.\n",
      "- **Watch Indicators**: Keep an eye on key indicators such as producer price index (PPI) and consumer price index (CPI) for signals of inflation trends.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Recommended Actions for Investors\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Evaluate Investment Portfolio**: Assess your current investment allocation to ensure it aligns with potential inflationary impacts. Consider increasing exposure to sectors traditionally resilient to inflation.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Stay Informed**: Continuously educate yourself on economic conditions through reliable financial news sources and reports. Staying informed will enhance your ability to make timely investment decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "As we progress through 2024, navigating the effects of inflation and its undeniable impact on the stock market requires adaptability and informed strategies. With the potential for volatility and sector-specific reactions, investors must approach their financial decisions with a keen awareness of both economic indicators and market dynamics. As always, consulting with financial advisors can provide additional guidance tailored to individual investment goals.\n",
